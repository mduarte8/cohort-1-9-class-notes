-Parent child relationships -> the parent element can also be called "container"

-Inline elements vs block elements

-Inline elements: allow other elements to be next to it horizontally (if there is enough space)
    -Span
    -img

-Block elements: Does not allow other elements to be next to it (even if there is enough space)
    -H1-H6 tags
    -Divs
    -p
    -semantic tags like "main" and "section"

-Flex container and flex items
    1. Flex container is the element that is the parent and its display property is === flex
        
    2. Flex items are the direct children of the flex container



-Properties for flex containers:
    * display: flex;
    * flex-direction: (row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse);
    * gap: 10px

-Properties for flex items:
    * flex: 1 (number here) -> allows us to determine the proportion of available space that the child item takes up in its parent container
