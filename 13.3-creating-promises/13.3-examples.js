//There is a better way to "wait" for async code to complete before executing more code-> Promises


//Promises allow us to make easier to write code that waits for async code to complete before running more code



//FS example from Platform, then convert to a promise




//three states of a Promise-> Pending, fulfilled, rejected




//promise will stay pending if there is no resolve in the promise




//show how to resolve a promise and catch any errors that occured if the promise did not resolve
